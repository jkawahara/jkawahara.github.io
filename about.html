  <p>Of the past lessons learned from the biotechnology space, I’ve found the effectiveness of relationships (users, engineers, product managers) the most compelling in shaping technology. Throughout the past two decades in engineering, I've observed significant knowledge and communication gaps disable clear understanding of requirements, resulting in software solutions that don’t achieve quality expectations.</p>
  <p>The ongoing investment in self-directed learning, including recent coding boot camp certification, sharpens my programming tools and further shapes my perspective of the technology landscape.</p>
  <p>My mission in taking on technology challenges continues with advocation of simple processes, automated solutions and knowledge sharing. The specific focus will be mitigating the gaps between users, engineers and product managers.</p>
