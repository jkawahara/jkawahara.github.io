In search of knowledge, it's challenging to know what questions to ask without a terminology base. After a dozen weeks, my preferred source for terminology has become podcasts... 

For boosting one's confidence, [Saron][saron] at [CodeNewbie][codenewbie]. Saron is always calming and chats with others who have transitioned from a different background or career.

For a technical deep dive, [Jeff][jeff] at [Software Engineering Daily][sed]. Jeff runs a tight ship; haven't missed a single podcast along the way.

For JavaScript emphasis, the [Panel][panel] at [JavaScript Jabber][jsj]. The Panel reminds me of the Wild West and the chaos that ensues...maybe this is intended but still able to pick up terminology and ongoings of JavaScript!
