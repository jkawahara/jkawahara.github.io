Stepping through [The Complete JavaScript Course 2018: Build Real Projects!][js-course], found myself headed down the function rabbit hole, which had an extensive tunnel system. Couldn't figure out which turn so just closed my eyes and stumbled onto the [Closure][mdn-closures] tunnel.

After reviewing MDN's closures topic, found [Let's Learn JavaScript Closures][learn-js-closures] seemed to reinforce with a few more examples. Thanks [Preethi][preethi]!

A detailed explanation of [LexicalEnvironment vs VariableEnvironment][emcascript-5], helpful in understanding closures. This article by [Dr. Axel Rauschmayer][dr-axel] is dated but he does provide a link to the current Standard EMCA-262 Language Specification.
