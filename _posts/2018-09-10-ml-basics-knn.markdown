"The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, easy-to-implement supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems. Pause! Let us unpack that." is covered in this article or audio, [Machine Learning Basics with the K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm][KNN], by [Onel Harrison](https://onelharrison.medium.com/).
