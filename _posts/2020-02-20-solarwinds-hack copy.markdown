"The Zero Day Initiative runs a hacker contest called Pwn2Own. The contest calls the best hackers in the world to demonstrate they can hack into software that should be secure. Like browsers, phones, and even cars. A lot of vulnerabilities are discovered from this event which means vendors must fix them. Whoever can demonstrate the most vulnerabilities will be crowned the “Master of Pwn.” is covered in this article or audio, [EP 82: MASTER OF PWN][Darknet Diaries], by [Jack Rhysider](https://darknetdiaries.com/about/).
