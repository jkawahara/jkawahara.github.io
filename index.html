Emphasizes agile organization & leverages empiricism, enabling active learning & collaboration by the community. Embraces innovative & lean mindset to maximize value & minimize waste.</p>
  <p>Process manufacturing taught lessons around the fundamentals of governance, standardization & cybersecurity when taking on challenges associated with OT technical debt. Additionally, the overall healthcare market matured and the expectation of significantly increased value with reduced costs became aspirational to stay ahead of the competition.</p>
  <p>As part of Industry 4.0, enabling technologies (AI, Robotics, IoT, VR/AR, Hyperautomation) can potentially be significant for manufacturing capabilities. The manufacturing leaders of tomorrow will be those who rely on a strategy process that is intentional (iterative with inputs & outputs), informed (OKR, customer/competitor/internal analysis), integrated with choices (arenas, vehicles, differentiators, staging, economic logic) & influences (supporting org arrangements), therefore, able to stay ahead of the digital revolution.</p>
