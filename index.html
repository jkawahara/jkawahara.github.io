  <p>Empathic design-based Engineer, passionate about solving problems by integrating technologies & leveraging the continuous improvement (CI) process. Approaches technology challenges by advocating for simple processes, automation & knowledge sharing while embracing a lean manufacturing mindset. Provides unique perspectives on user interaction with data & software tools. Enables collaboration across users, engineers & product management in emphasizing visual data analytics for powerful experiences.</p>
  <p>Of the lessons learned from the biotechnology space, Iâ€™ve found the effectiveness of relationships (users, engineers, product managers) the most compelling in shaping technology. A community that actively collaborates in understanding business drivers and requirements from project conception, will be better prepared for development and operational challenges, including knowledge and communication obstacles.
