I"s<p>Stepping through <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/">The Complete JavaScript Course 2018: Build Real Projects!</a>, found myself headed down the function rabbit hole, which had an extensive tunnel system. Couldn’t figure out which turn so just closed my eyes and stumbled onto the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures">Closure</a> tunnel.</p>

<p>After reviewing MDN’s closures topic, found <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/lets-learn-javascript-closures-66feb44f6a44?gi=2e3fa39717d9">Let’s Learn JavaScript Closures</a> seemed to reinforce with a few more examples.

<p>Updated 2018-10-25…
A detailed explanation of <a href="http://2ality.com/2011/04/ecmascript-5-spec-lexicalenvironment.html">LexicalEnvironment vs VariableEnvironment</a>, helpful in understanding closures. This article by <a href="http://dr-axel.de/">Dr. Axel Rauschmayer</a> is dated but he does provide a link to the current Standard EMCA-262 Language Specification.</p>
