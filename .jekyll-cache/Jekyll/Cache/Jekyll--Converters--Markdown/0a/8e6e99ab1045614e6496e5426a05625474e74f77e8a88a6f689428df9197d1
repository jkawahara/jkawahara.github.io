<p>â€œThe Zero Day Initiative runs a hacker contest called Pwn2Own. The contest calls the best hackers in the world to demonstrate they can hack into software that should be secure. Like browsers, phones, and even cars. A lot of vulnerabilities are discovered from this event which means vendors must fix them. Whoever can demonstrate the most vulnerabilities will be crowned the â€œMaster of Pwn.â€ is covered in this article or audio, <a href="https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/82/">EP 82: MASTER OF PWN</a>, by <a href="https://darknetdiaries.com/about/">Jack Rhysider</a>.</p>
