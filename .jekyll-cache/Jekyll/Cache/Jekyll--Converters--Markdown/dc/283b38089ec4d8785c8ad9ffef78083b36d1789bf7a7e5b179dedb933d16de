<p>“…There is continuing discussion about what exactly constitutes an intelligent edge, and the definition continues to evolve.  Some in the edge device industry maintain the edge is between the IoT device and the cloud, and define it as a range of smaller vertically dedicated clouds.  These “mini” clouds are more energy efficient and reduce the inherent latency of moving massive amounts of data from devices and sensors to large scale data center enterprise clouds. There appears, however, to be a consensus forming that embedded intelligence in the edge devices, powered by next generation processors designed specifically for AI and inference-based machine learning will drive the future of IoT and its implementation….” is covered in this article, <a href="https://www.arcweb.com/blog/modern-ai-drives-embedded-intelligent-edge">Modern AI Drives the Embedded Intelligent Edge</a>, by <a href="https://twitter.com/dslansky">Dick Slansky</a>.</p>
