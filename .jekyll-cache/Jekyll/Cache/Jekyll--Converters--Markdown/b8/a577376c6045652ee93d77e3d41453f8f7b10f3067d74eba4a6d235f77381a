<p>“The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, easy-to-implement supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems. Pause! Let us unpack that.” is covered in this article or audio, <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-basics-with-the-k-nearest-neighbors-algorithm-6a6e71d01761">Machine Learning Basics with the K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm</a>, by <a href="https://onelharrison.medium.com/">Onel Harrison</a>.</p>
