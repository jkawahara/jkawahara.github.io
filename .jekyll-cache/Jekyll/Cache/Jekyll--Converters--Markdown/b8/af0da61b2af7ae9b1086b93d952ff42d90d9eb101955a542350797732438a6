<p>For boosting one’s confidence, <a href="https://twitter.com/saronyitbarek">Saron</a> at <a href="https://www.codenewbie.org/">CodeNewbie</a>. Saron is always calming and chats with others who have transitioned from a different background or career.</p>

<p>For a technical deep dive, <a href="https://twitter.com/the_prion?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Jeff</a> at <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/all-episodes/exclusive-content/Podcast/">Software Engineering Daily</a>. Jeff runs a tight ship; haven’t missed a single podcast along the way.</p>

<p>For JavaScript emphasis, the <a href="https://twitter.com/jsjabber?lang=en">Panel</a> at <a href="https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/">JavaScript Jabber</a>. The Panel reminds me of the Wild West and the chaos that ensues…maybe this is intended but still able to pick up terminology and ongoings of JavaScript!</p>
